 ## Introduction to Spring Framework
- Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.

## Dependency Injection
- Dependency injection (DI) is a powerful design pattern in Spring that helps create loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable applications.

## Coupling
- This refers to the degree of interdependence between different parts of your code.

## Loose Coupling
- loose coupling, which means that changes in one part of your code have minimal impact on other parts.

- Loose coupling in Spring refers to the design principle of keeping components loosely dependent on each other. This is achieved through the use of interfaces, dependency injection, and other Spring features.


## Tight Coupling
- When a group of classes is highly dependent on each other, or we've classes that assume a lot of responsibilities is called tight coupling. Another scenario is when an object creates another object for its usage.
