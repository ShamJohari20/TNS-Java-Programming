## Spring



## Beans

- In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application.

- In the context of the Spring Framework, beans refer to objects managed by the Spring Inversion of Control (IoC) container. These objects are the building blocks of your Spring application and are responsible for implementing its core functionalities.

## Example 

## record

- A record is a new feature in Java 14 that is a concise way to declare a data class with fields and a constructor. Records are immutable by default, which means that their fields cannot be changed after they are created. This makes them ideal for use cases where data integrity is important.

## DF BW record && Class 

- Records are immutable data classes that require only the type and name of fields.

So ,the main difference between class and record type in Java is that a record has the main purpose of storing data, while a class defines responsibility. Records are immutable, while classes are not.
